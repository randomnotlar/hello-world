# hello-world
My first repository

I am working on a self-driving toy car project. Just completed the CS231n at Stanford. Now I need to use YOLO-ROS or something like that o keep going. I saw a link on the ubuntu webpage and that redirected me to github. I have seen github before but this is the first time I am using it. It look cool!
